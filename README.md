# Everything App Infrastructure

## Overview

Welcome to the **Everything App Infrastructure** project! This repository contains foundational infrastructure code written in **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Solidity** designed to power decentralized applications (dApps), providing utilities and smart contract setups for key use cases in blockchain development.

The goal of this repository is to offer adaptable, reusable components that can serve as building blocks for any decentralized application (dApp), making it easy for developers to integrate critical features into their applications.

The infrastructure covers three primary technologies:

1. **Python Utilities**: General-purpose utilities to help with tasks such as file management, data processing, and API handling.
2. **JavaScript Utilities**: Key utilities and helpers used for smart contract interaction, event handling, and more.
3. **Solidity Contracts**: Essential smart contract code, including staking, liquidity pools, and token management.

## Python

The **Python** folder contains essential utilities for everyday tasks such as data processing, API handling, and file management. Each utility is designed to handle common scenarios that developers face when interacting with files or APIs.

- **File Manager** (`file_manager.py`): Utility functions for handling file operations such as reading, writing, and managing files and directories.
- **Data Processor** (`data_processor.py`): A utility for processing datasets, transforming them into usable formats and filtering data.
- **API Handler** (`api_handler.py`): Utility functions to interact with external APIs, handling requests and responses in an efficient manner.

### Tests

The tests for these utilities are located in the `tests` folder. Each test is written to ensure that the corresponding utility behaves as expected and passes common edge cases.

- **Test File Manager** (`test_file_manager.py`): Tests for file management functions, checking reading, writing, and deletion functionality.
- **Test Data Processor** (`test_data_processor.py`): Tests for data processing utilities, including data cleaning, transformation, and filtering.
- **Test API Handler** (`test_api_handler.py`): Tests for API interaction functionality, ensuring proper handling of requests and responses.

## JavaScript

The **JavaScript** folder contains essential utilities and testing setups for interacting with smart contracts and managing event-driven workflows on decentralized platforms.

### Utilities

In this section, the following utilities are provided:

- **Web3.js Setup**: Simplified functions to interact with Ethereum-based smart contracts.
- **Contract Interaction**: Utility functions for deploying, interacting, and calling functions on Ethereum smart contracts (e.g., Token transfers, reading contract states).
- **Event Listeners**: Event-driven utilities to listen for events emitted by smart contracts and handle them asynchronously.

### Tests

The **tests** folder contains unit tests for the JavaScript utilities using **Mocha** and **Chai**. These tests ensure that the utilities work as expected, particularly when interacting with live Ethereum smart contracts.

## Solidity

The **Solidity** folder contains essential smart contracts for creating decentralized applications. These smart contracts provide functionality for staking, liquidity pools, and token management.

### Key Contracts

- **Staking Contract** (`StakingContract.sol`): Allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards based on the amount of tokens staked and the duration of the stake.
- **Liquidity Pool Contract** (`LiquidityPool.sol`): A contract for managing liquidity pools, enabling users to provide liquidity in exchange for LP tokens and trading fees. It includes features for adding/removing liquidity and collecting fees.
- **ERC-20 Token Contract** (`ERC20Token.sol`): A standard implementation of the ERC-20 token with added functionalities like pausing/unpausing transfers and minting.

### Tests

- **Staking Contract Tests** (`test_staking_contract.js`): These tests verify the staking functionality, including staking, withdrawing, and rewards calculations.
- **Liquidity Pool Tests** (`test_liquidity_pool.js`): These tests ensure that liquidity pool operations work as expected, covering adding/removing liquidity, fee collection, and LP token minting.

## How to Use

### Setting Up Python Utilities

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/MattKimbel/everything-app-infrastructure.git
2. Navigate to the Python utilities folder and install dependencies: cd everything-app-infrastructure/Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Use the utilities in your Python project:
- Import the modules where needed and call the functions as described in the respective files.

### Setting Up JavaScript Utilities

1. Install **Web3.js** for interacting with Ethereum: npm install web3
2. Use the utility functions to interact with smart contracts, deploy them, or listen to events.

### Deploying Solidity Contracts

1. Install the required tools (`hardhat` or `truffle`):npm install –save-dev hardhat
2. Deploy the contracts using **Hardhat** or **Truffle**:npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
