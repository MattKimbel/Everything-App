Everything App Infrastructure

Overview

Welcome to the Everything App Infrastructure project! This repository is a versatile and extensible foundation for building robust applications, tailored to address modern development needs. It combines Python, JavaScript, and Solidity utilities and components, offering developers a comprehensive toolkit for both traditional and decentralized applications.

Key Features:
	1.	Python Utilities: Simplify tasks like file management, data processing, and API handling.
	2.	JavaScript Utilities: Enable dynamic interaction with the DOM, manage HTTP requests, and streamline local storage handling.
	3.	Solidity Contracts: Provide the backbone for decentralized features such as staking, liquidity pools, and token management.

This infrastructure is designed to save time, encourage scalability, and deliver ready-to-use solutions for common development challenges.

Python

Utilities:
	1.	File Manager (file_manager.py): Simplifies file operations such as reading, writing, and managing directories.
	2.	Data Processor (data_processor.py): Handles data processing tasks, including filtering, transformation, and aggregation.
	3.	API Handler (api_handler.py): Provides streamlined methods for interacting with APIs, including request handling and response parsing.

Tests:

Each utility has its corresponding test file located in the tests folder:
	•	test_file_manager.py: Validates file management operations and edge cases.
	•	test_data_processor.py: Ensures data processing logic functions correctly.
	•	test_api_handler.py: Confirms API interaction reliability and error handling.

## JavaScript

JavaScript

Utilities:
	1.	DOM Manipulator (DOMManipulator.js): Offers utility functions to dynamically modify and manipulate DOM elements.
	2.	HTTP Request Handler (HTTPRequestHandler.js): Provides a simple interface for handling HTTP requests using fetch with added support for error handling.
	3.	Storage Handler (StorageHandler.js): Manages local and session storage operations, including data saving, retrieval, and removal.

Tests:

The tests folder contains unit tests for each utility, ensuring they function as expected:
	•	test_DOMManipulator.js: Validates DOM manipulation functions, ensuring proper element handling and updates.
	•	test_HTTPRequestHandler.js: Tests HTTP request handling for both successful and erroneous scenarios.
	•	test_StorageHandler.js: Verifies local and session storage operations, including edge cases.

## Solidity

Contracts:
	1.	Liquidity Pool Contract (LiquidityPool.sol): Enables users to provide liquidity, manage trading fees, and mint LP tokens.
	2.	Staking Contract (Staking.sol): Implements staking functionality, allowing users to earn rewards based on staked amounts and duration.
	3.	Token Contract (Token.sol): A customizable ERC-20 token contract with advanced features such as pausing, minting, and burning.

Tests:

The tests folder contains JavaScript files for testing the Solidity contracts:
	•	TestLiquidityPool.js: Validates the liquidity pool’s operations, including adding/removing liquidity and fee management.
	•	TestStaking.js: Tests staking functionality, including reward calculations and withdrawal logic.
	•	TestToken.js: Ensures token contract features like transfers, minting, and burning work as expected.
