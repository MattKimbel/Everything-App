# Everything App Infrastructure

## Overview

Welcome to the Everything App Infrastructure project! This repository provides a comprehensive foundation for creating versatile and adaptable applications, designed to address everyday development needs. With robust utilities in Python and JavaScript alongside Solidity smart contracts, this repository serves as a one-stop solution for building and integrating both traditional and decentralized application features.

The aim is to deliver flexible, reusable components that simplify development, encourage extensibility, and empower developers to focus on creating impactful solutions without starting from scratch.

Key Features:
	1.	Python Utilities: Tools for file management, data processing, and API interaction to support general application development.
	2.	JavaScript Utilities: Libraries for event handling, smart contract interaction, and process automation.
	3.	Solidity Contracts: Foundational components for decentralized applications, including staking, token management, and liquidity pool contracts.

This infrastructure ensures developers can build reliable and scalable applications while integrating the latest technologies, including blockchain.

Python

Utilities:
	1.	File Manager (file_manager.py): Simplifies file operations such as reading, writing, and organizing files.
	2.	Data Processor (data_processor.py): Processes datasets, handles filtering, and transforms data for practical use.
	3.	API Handler (api_handler.py): Facilitates seamless integration with external APIs, ensuring efficient request and response handling.

Tests:
	•	Located in tests/, each Python utility has dedicated test files:
	•	test_file_manager.py: Validates file operations, including edge cases.
	•	test_data_processor.py: Ensures data processing methods handle input effectively.
	•	test_api_handler.py: Confirms robust handling of API requests and responses.

## JavaScript

The **JavaScript** folder contains essential utilities and testing setups for interacting with smart contracts and managing event-driven workflows on decentralized platforms.

### Utilities

In this section, the following utilities are provided:

- **Web3.js Setup**: Simplified functions to interact with Ethereum-based smart contracts.
- **Contract Interaction**: Utility functions for deploying, interacting, and calling functions on Ethereum smart contracts (e.g., Token transfers, reading contract states).
- **Event Listeners**: Event-driven utilities to listen for events emitted by smart contracts and handle them asynchronously.

### Tests

The **tests** folder contains unit tests for the JavaScript utilities using **Mocha** and **Chai**. These tests ensure that the utilities work as expected, particularly when interacting with live Ethereum smart contracts.

## Solidity

The **Solidity** folder contains essential smart contracts for creating decentralized applications. These smart contracts provide functionality for staking, liquidity pools, and token management.

### Key Contracts

- **Staking Contract** (`StakingContract.sol`): Allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards based on the amount of tokens staked and the duration of the stake.
- **Liquidity Pool Contract** (`LiquidityPool.sol`): A contract for managing liquidity pools, enabling users to provide liquidity in exchange for LP tokens and trading fees. It includes features for adding/removing liquidity and collecting fees.
- **ERC-20 Token Contract** (`ERC20Token.sol`): A standard implementation of the ERC-20 token with added functionalities like pausing/unpausing transfers and minting.

### Tests

- **Staking Contract Tests** (`test_staking_contract.js`): These tests verify the staking functionality, including staking, withdrawing, and rewards calculations.
- **Liquidity Pool Tests** (`test_liquidity_pool.js`): These tests ensure that liquidity pool operations work as expected, covering adding/removing liquidity, fee collection, and LP token minting.

## How to Use

### Setting Up Python Utilities

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/MattKimbel/everything-app-infrastructure.git
2. Navigate to the Python utilities folder and install dependencies: cd everything-app-infrastructure/Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Use the utilities in your Python project:
- Import the modules where needed and call the functions as described in the respective files.

### Setting Up JavaScript Utilities

1. Install **Web3.js** for interacting with Ethereum: npm install web3
2. Use the utility functions to interact with smart contracts, deploy them, or listen to events.

### Deploying Solidity Contracts

1. Install the required tools (`hardhat` or `truffle`):npm install –save-dev hardhat
2. Deploy the contracts using **Hardhat** or **Truffle**:npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
